## What I am Using

Just React & SASS (Supported by React 2.0 through node-sass installation)

### How Are You Learning?

I taught myself CSS through YouTube and am basically using that prior knowledge to code SASS (which is must simpler)
As for React, I have some HTML5 and JavaScript experience and am using online documentation and YouTube to learn React.js!
